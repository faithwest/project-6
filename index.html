<p> Bacon is a by-product of pigs. The word bacon means “meat from the back of an
  animal.”
  American bacon is made from the pork belly, which
  accounts for its trademark streaks of fat. European and Canadian bacon are
  still made from the back meat of a pig, which is considerably leaner.
  70% of all bacon in the US is eaten at breakfast
  time.
  More than 2 billion pounds of bacon is produced each
  year in the US.
  The phrase “bringing home the bacon” originated back
  in the 12th century when a church in England offered a side of bacon
  to any man who could swear before the church that he had not fought or
  quarreled with his wife for a year and a day. Any man who could “bring home the
  bacon” was highly respected in his community.</p>
